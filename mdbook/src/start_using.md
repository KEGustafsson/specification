# Getting Started Using Signal K

You can start using Signal K by

* connecting to the [demo server](http://demo.signalk.org/) on the Internet with any web browser
* installing [SK server](https://github.com/signalk/signalk-server-node) on any computer
* getting some hardware for your boat, such as a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), suitable
  USB adapters for your boatâ€™s network ([NMEA 0183](http://digitalyacht.co.uk/product/usb-nmea-adaptor/),
  [NMEA 2000](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/wiki/FAQ:-Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-do-i-integrate-with-nmea2000-can-bus) or roll your own with
  [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) sensors) and installing the server
* For sensors over WiFi take a look at [SensESP](https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP)
* installing [OpenPlotter](https://openplotter.readthedocs.io/en/3.x.x/), which includes a Signal K server

Once you have a server running (or you start by using the demo server) you can install some Signal K supporting mobile
apps such as [WilhelmSK](https://www.wilhelmsk.com/) (iOS).
